# OpenSourceChess
my own bare bones - open source implementation of chess built with Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
         
Curently only local Multiplayer, this may change in the future
       
This is my first full JS project, and took about a week and a half to make the initial codebase.

**TO-DO:**      
Better UI stuff      
Castling              
Pin Pieces based on whether they will reveal LOS with the king as to prevent unecessary checks.        
         
eventually online multiplayer
