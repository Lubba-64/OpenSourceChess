the reason I am writing up a separate file for this is purely because
I don't want to shove the readme with useless info only the person wanting
to contribute to the repo will want to know

so first up this project is completely, fully finished now. I will not return to add to this repo

I encourage someone to Co-opt this code and use it for commercial purpose. that means it would have a nice home.

I commented all the code I could so that you can get an easier grasp on whats doing what although I could have
been more descriptive with how it all works, especially the board manager.

some things to note / do that I didn't if you want this to be more viable:

    change how piece moves work. special moves use "args" for special movement actions (castling, en passant). 
    something that would work better would be to return a list of positions to set to specific pieces:
    EX: set x,y to rook, and set that to a none tile. 

    add castling please, I decided not to add it because I needed to move onto other projects:

    add the ability for pieces to be pinned if they are preventing a check. 
    (if they move they will put the king in check which is illegal)
    its not hard to do i just had to move on

    better UI scaling method for the chess board. the CSSContoller.ts BS is stupid. redo the UI scaling.

    other than that its fully functioning, with there being a likelyhood of more unseen bugs :/
    oh well time to move on. to new projects I go!
